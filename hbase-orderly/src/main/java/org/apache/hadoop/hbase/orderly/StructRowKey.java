/** Serialize and deserialize a struct (record) row key into a sortable
 * byte array. 
 *
 * <p>A struct row key is a composed of a fixed number of fields.
 * Each field is a subclass of {@link RowKey} (and may even be another struct).
 * The struct is sorted by its field values in the order in which the fields 
 * are declared.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Structs allow for composite row keys. This is similar to a multi-column 
 * primary key or index in MySQL, where the primary key is a struct and the 
 * columns are field row keys.</p>
 *
 * <h1> Serialization Format </h1>
 * The struct row key does not serialize any additional bytes beyond those 
 * used to serialize each of its fields in sequential order. The struct
 * serializes an array of values by simply serializing the first value using
 * the first row key, followed by the second value serialized with the second 
 * row key, and so forth. No bytes are serialized directly by the struct class 
 * at all, so no additional bytes are inserted before, after, or in between 
 * values serialized by the field row keys. In all cases except the implicit
 * termination cases mentioned below, field row keys have {@link #termination}
 * set to true to force each field row key to be self-terminating.
 * 
 * <h1> Implicit and Explicit Termination </h1>
 * The struct row key does not directly serialize any bytes and thus 
 * termination flags do not directly affect the serialization. Instead, 
 * the struct row controls explicit and implicit termination settings by 
 * manipulating the must terminate flags of the field row keys using
 * {@link #setTermination}.
 *
 * <p>If <code>mustTerminate</code> is true, then the mustTerminate flag is set 
 * to true in all field row keys. However, if <code>mustTerminate</code>
 * is false, we can set the must terminate flag to false for any field row key 
 * that is followed by an uninterrupted trailing suffix of ascending-sorted 
 * NULL values. This is because NULL values encoded via ascending sort 
 * are zero-length in all row key formats (assuming <code>mustTerminate</code>
 * is false). In the extreme, a struct with must terminate set to false and all 
 * fields in ascending sort order would serialize a set of null objects to a
 * zero-byte array. All other field row keys (those that are followed by any 
 * serialized value with non-zero length) will have the must terminate flag set
 * to true in the field row key.</p>
 *
 * <h1> Struct Prefixes </h1>
 * Given a serialized struct row key, you may deserialize fields from the 
 * serialized byte representation using any <i>prefix</i> of the struct row 
 * key. For example, if a struct consisting of a long, string, and float
 * is serialized, then fields may be deserialized using a row key consisting of 
 * a long and string, or by using a row key consisting of a single 
 * long. Any trailing fields omitted from the prefix row key will be ignored
 * during deserialization. In the above example, the (long, string) row key 
 * would return a two-element (long object, string object) deserialized result, 
 * ignoring the trailing serialized float as this was not included in the 
 * struct prefix's definition.
 *
 * <h1> NULL </h1>
 * Structs themselves may not be NULL. However, struct fields may be NULL 
 * (so long as the underlying field row key supports NULL), so you can create a 
 * struct where every field is NULL. 
 *
 * <h1> Descending sort </h1>
 * To sort in descending order we invert the sort order of each field row key.
 *
 * <h1> Usage </h1>
 * Structs impose no extra space during serialization, or object copy overhead
 * at runtime. The storage and runtime costs of a struct row key are the
 * sum of the costs of each of its field row keys.
