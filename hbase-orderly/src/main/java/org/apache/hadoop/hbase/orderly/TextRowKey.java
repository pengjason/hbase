/** Serialize and deserialize Hadoop Text Objects into sortable byte arrays.
 * The serialization and deserialization method are identical to 
 * {@link UTF8RowKey} after converting the Text to/from a UTF-8 byte
 * array.
 *
 * <h1> Usage </h1>
 * This is the second fastest class for storing characters and strings. No
 * objetc copies are made when serializing. Unfortunately, there is no way to
 * force a Text object to use an existing byte array without copying its 
 * contents, so one copy is required when deserializing. This class re-uses
 * Text objects during deserialization, although the byte array
 * backing the Text object is not re-used.
