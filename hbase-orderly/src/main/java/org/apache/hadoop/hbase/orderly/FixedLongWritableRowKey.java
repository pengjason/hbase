/** Serializes and deserializes LongWritables into a sortable 
 * fixed-length byte array representation.
 *
 * <p>This format ensures that all longs sort in their natural order, as
 * they would sort when using signed longs comparison.</p>
 *
 * <h1>Serialization Format</h1>
 * All longs are serialized to an 8-byte, fixed-width sortable byte format.
 * Serialization is performed by inverting the long sign bit and writing the
 * resulting bytes to the byte array in big endian order. 
 *
 * <h1>NULL</h1>
 * Like all fixed-width integer types, this class does <i>NOT</i> support null
 * value types. If you need null support use {@link LongWritableRowKey}.
 *
 * <h1>Descending sort</h1>
 * To sort in descending order we perform the same encodings as in ascending 
 * sort, except we logically invert (take the 1's complement of) each byte. 
 *
 * <h1>Usage</h1>
 * This is the fastest class for storing fixed width 64-bit ints. Use 
 * {@link LongWritableRowKey} for a more compact, variable-length representation
 * in almost all cases. This format is only more compact if longs most
 * frequently require 59 or more bits to store (including the sign bit).
