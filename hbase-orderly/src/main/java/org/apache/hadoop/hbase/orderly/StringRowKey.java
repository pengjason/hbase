/** Serialize and deserialize Java Strings into row keys.
 * The serialization and deserialization method are identical to 
 * {@link UTF8RowKey} after converting the Java String to/from a UTF-8 byte
 * array.
 *
 * <h1> Usage </h1>
 * This is the slowest class for storing characters and strings. One copy is 
 * made during serialization/deserialization, and furthermore the String
 * objects themselves cannot be re-used across multiple deserializations.
 * Weigh the cost of additional object instantiation
 * and copying against the benefits of being able to use all of the various 
 * handy and tidy String functions in Java.
