/** Serialize and deserialize unsigned long integers into fixed-width, sortable 
 * byte arrays. 
 *
 * <p>The serialization and deserialization method are identical to 
 * {@link FixedLongWritableRowKey}, except the sign bit of the long is not
 * negated during serialization.</p>
 *
 * <h1> Usage </h1>
 * This is the fastest class for storing fixed width 64-bit unsigned ints. Use 
 * {@link UnsignedLongWritableRowKey} for a more compact, variable-length 
 * representation. This format is more compact only if integers most frequently
 * require 59 or more bits to store.
