/** Serialize and deserialize Unsigned Long Objects into a fixed-length 
 * sortable byte array representation. 
 *
 * <p>The serialization and deserialization methods are identical to 
 * {@link FixedUnsignedLongWritableRowKey} after converting the LongWritable 
 * to/from a Long</p>.
 *
 * <h1> Usage </h1>
 * This is the slower class for storing unsigned longs. One copy is made when
 * serializing and deserializing. Unfortunately Long objects are 
 * immutable and thus cannot be re-used across multiple deserializations.
 * However, deserialized primitive longs are first passed to 
 * {@link Long#valueOf}, so boxed Long values may be shared if the 
 * <code>valueOf</code> method has frequent cache hits.
