/** Serialize and deserialize unsigned integers into fixed-width, sortable 
 * byte arrays. 
 *
 * <p>The serialization and deserialization method are identical to 
 * {@link FixedIntWritableRowKey}, except that the sign bit of the integer is 
 * not negated during serialization.</p>
 *
 * <h1> Usage </h1>
 * This is the fastest class for storing fixed width 32-bit unsigned ints. Use
 * {@link UnsignedIntWritableRowKey} for a more compact, variable-length 
 * representation. This format is more compact only if integers most 
 * frequently require 28 bits or more bits to store.
